                    Researchers have been investigating <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5635200/">summer learning loss</a> for years, sometimes called “summer slide.” Children who don’t practice new skills over the summer months often return to school at a disadvantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you have a plan to keep your child learning and growing once the weather gets warm?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If not, we can help! There is no reason why parents and caregivers can’t incorporate playful learning activities to keep little ones on their toes all summer long!
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way to keep your kids learning throughout the summer is by introducing beach theme preschool activities. Children can explore, write, draw, and practice new skills through play. The fun, beachy theme will keep little ones engaged and excited about learning!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You don’t need to be a trained teacher to keep your child busy, either. We’ve created this guide to help you find an appropriate learning activity for young children. Keep reading to learn how to foster academic skills with activities inspired by the sand and the sun!

                    Beach Theme Activities for Infants
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ideal activities for babies allow them to explore their senses while they work to develop hand-eye coordination. Since our <a href="https://www.happybunnies.co.uk/preschool-curriculum/">littlest learners</a> tend to explore by putting things in their mouths, it can be challenging to find sensory materials that don’t pose a hazard. Our favourite, plentiful sensory material for infants, is in abundance: water!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Water play is a beautiful way to help babies cool down on warmer summer days! Young infants can splash and explore cause and effect. Older infants can manipulate tools or explore simple buoyancy with rubber ducks and toy boats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t be afraid to pull out the paddling pool for full-body sensory fun! You must supervise infants at all times around water. If you are willing to <a href="https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a539332/swimming-with-your-baby">get into the water</a> with your little one, they can reap wonderful gross-motor development benefits!
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Beach Themed Activities for Toddlers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As your little one ages, their hand-eye coordination will improve enough to manipulate materials in new and exciting ways! While toddlers adore water play, you might introduce an equally compelling beach-themed sensory material: sand!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children will learn lessons about quantity and conservation as they transfer sand from container to container. They will gain mastery over tools as they scoop and sift the sand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talk about the way the sand feels as you play together. It’s a beautiful way to introduce rich new vocabulary words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Toddlers also love a treasure hunt! You can introduce concepts such as shapes and colours by burying objects in the sand. Ask your little one to name the shape or colour of each object as they find them!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can <a href="https://www.happybunnies.co.uk/5-preschool-activities-that-are-fun-and-engaging/">elevate the activities</a> for advanced learners by incorporating a sorting activity. Have your toddler sort by shape or colour. They can place the objects into coordinating sand pails.

                <h2>
                    Beach Preschool Activities for Three-Year-Olds
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three-year-old children can care for and manipulate small objects. Why not introduce them to some scientific inquiry?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gather a series of enticing beach artefacts such as shells, sea stars, beach glass, sand dollars, or smooth stones. Present them with magnifying glasses and allow them to explore!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After making some observations, it’s time to bring out the art supplies. Challenge your three-year-old to “draw like a scientist.” This encourages them to record what they see, practising mathematical skills like <a href="https://earlymath.erikson.edu/why-one-to-one-correspondence-math-matters/">one-to-one correspondence</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s a beautiful opportunity to teach the correct pencil grip. Show your child how holding a crayon or pencil correctly allows them to draw with more precision. It will also make their fingers stronger and help them build stamina for writing later on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can extend this activity by discussing living and non-living things. Are the objects they are exploring living? Have they ever been alive?
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>
                    Summer Preschool Activities for Four-Year-Olds
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Four-year-olds are curious, capable little people, eager to explore letters and their sounds! If you can, bring your child to visit a beach. You might even get a scavenger hunt to encourage exploration and careful observation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you’ve returned home, ask your child to journal about the experience. At four years old, illustrations are how your child communicates best. Encourage your child to record the details they noticed on their trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When they’re done with their picture, begin labelling. Slowly say the names of different parts of the picture. Help your child to notice and name the initial sounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your child is writing, have them label each object in the picture with its first letter. It’s okay if their guess is incorrect. For example, a child writing the word “clam” might label it with the letter “k.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your child is not yet writing, you can help by taking dictation. You can also offer alternate tools, such as rubber alphabet stamps or letter stickers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can extend this activity by hiding alphabet magnets or alphabet puzzle pieces in a sand tray. Encourage your child to name the letter and its sound. They can then put the alphabet in order!
                </p>

                    Beach Theme Preschool Activities for Children Entering Reception
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Children entering reception are eager to write. You can provide a unique canvas by encouraging them to write and draw in the sand!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cover the surface of a shallow activity tray with dry sand. Provide several simple, beach-themed words supported by images. Encourage your child to use their finger to write each word in the sand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can do a larger-than-life version of this activity, too! Bring your child outdoors to a sandy area. Encourage them to find a nice stick. Supervise them carefully as they practice writing their name on the ground!
