            Researchers have been investigating
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5635200/"
              >summer learning loss</a
            >
            for years, sometimes called “summer slide.” Children who don’t
            practice new skills over the summer months often return to school at
            a disadvantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you have a plan to keep your child learning and growing once the
            weather gets warm?
          </p>
          <p>
            If not, we can help! There is no reason why parents and caregivers
            can’t incorporate playful learning activities to keep little ones on
            their toes all summer long!
          </p>
          <p>
            One way to keep your kids learning throughout the summer is by
            introducing beach theme preschool activities. Children can explore,
            write, draw, and practice new skills through play. The fun, beachy
            theme will keep little ones engaged and excited about learning!
          </p>
          <p>
            You don’t need to be a trained teacher to keep your child busy,
            either. We’ve created this guide to help you find an appropriate
            learning activity for young children. Keep reading to learn how to
            foster academic skills with activities inspired by the sand and the
            sun!

          <h2>Beach Theme Activities for Infants</h2>
          <p>
            The ideal activities for babies allow them to explore their senses
            while they work to develop hand-eye coordination. Since our
            <a href="https://www.happybunnies.co.uk/preschool-curriculum/"
              >littlest learners</a
            >
            tend to explore by putting things in their mouths, it can be
            challenging to find sensory materials that don’t pose a hazard. Our
            favourite, plentiful sensory material for infants, is in abundance:
            water!
          </p>
          <p>
            Water play is a beautiful way to help babies cool down on warmer
            summer days! Young infants can splash and explore cause and effect.
            Older infants can manipulate tools or explore simple buoyancy with
            rubber ducks and toy boats.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t be afraid to pull out the paddling pool for full-body sensory
            fun! You must supervise infants at all times around water. If you
            are willing to
            <a
              href="https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a539332/swimming-with-your-baby"
              >get into the water</a
            >
            with your little one, they can reap wonderful gross-motor
            development benefits!
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>Beach Themed Activities for Toddlers</h2>
          <p>
            As your little one ages, their hand-eye coordination will improve
            enough to manipulate materials in new and exciting ways! While
            toddlers adore water play, you might introduce an equally compelling
            beach-themed sensory material: sand!
          </p>
          <p>
            Children will learn lessons about quantity and conservation as they
            transfer sand from container to container. They will gain mastery
            over tools as they scoop and sift the sand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talk about the way the sand feels as you play together. It’s a
            beautiful way to introduce rich new vocabulary words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Toddlers also love a treasure hunt! You can introduce concepts such
            as shapes and colours by burying objects in the sand. Ask your
            little one to name the shape or colour of each object as they find
            them!
          </p>
          <p>
            You can
            <a

              >elevate the activities</a
            >
            for advanced learners by incorporating a sorting activity. Have your
            toddler sort by shape or colour. They can place the objects into
            coordinating sand pails.

          <h2>Beach Preschool Activities for Three-Year-Olds</h2>
          <p>
            Three-year-old children can care for and manipulate small objects.
            Why not introduce them to some scientific inquiry?
          </p>
          <p>
            Gather a series of enticing beach artefacts such as shells, sea
            stars, beach glass, sand dollars, or smooth stones. Present them
            with magnifying glasses and allow them to explore!
          </p>
          <p>
            After making some observations, it’s time to bring out the art
            supplies. Challenge your three-year-old to “draw like a scientist.”
            This encourages them to record what they see, practising
            mathematical skills like
            <a
              href="https://earlymath.erikson.edu/why-one-to-one-correspondence-math-matters/"
              >one-to-one correspondence</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s a beautiful opportunity to teach the correct pencil grip. Show
            your child how holding a crayon or pencil correctly allows them to
            draw with more precision. It will also make their fingers stronger
            and help them build stamina for writing later on!
          </p>
          <p>
            You can extend this activity by discussing living and non-living
            things. Are the objects they are exploring living? Have they ever
            been alive?
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Summer Preschool Activities for Four-Year-Olds</h2>
          <p>
            Four-year-olds are curious, capable little people, eager to explore
            letters and their sounds! If you can, bring your child to visit a
            beach. You might even get a scavenger hunt to encourage exploration
            and careful observation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you’ve returned home, ask your child to journal about the
            experience. At four years old, illustrations are how your child
            communicates best. Encourage your child to record the details they
            noticed on their trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            When they’re done with their picture, begin labelling. Slowly say
            the names of different parts of the picture. Help your child to
            notice and name the initial sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your child is writing, have them label each object in the picture
            with its first letter. It’s okay if their guess is incorrect. For
            example, a child writing the word “clam” might label it with the
            letter “k.”
          </p>
          <p>
            If your child is not yet writing, you can help by taking dictation.
            You can also offer alternate tools, such as rubber alphabet stamps
            or letter stickers.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can extend this activity by hiding alphabet magnets or alphabet
            puzzle pieces in a sand tray. Encourage your child to name the
            letter and its sound. They can then put the alphabet in order!
          </p>

          <h2>
            Beach Theme Preschool Activities for Children Entering Reception
          </h2>
          <p>
            Children entering reception are eager to write. You can provide a
            unique canvas by encouraging them to write and draw in the sand!
          </p>
          <p>
            Cover the surface of a shallow activity tray with dry sand. Provide
            several simple, beach-themed words supported by images. Encourage
            your child to use their finger to write each word in the sand.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can do a larger-than-life version of this activity, too! Bring
            your child outdoors to a sandy area. Encourage them to find a nice
            stick. Supervise them carefully as they practice writing their name
            on the ground!
